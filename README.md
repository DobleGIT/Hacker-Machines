## About The Project
This end-of-degree project consists of a web platform to learn cybersecurity that has been given the name of Hacker Machines, in which the learning process
consists of carrying out different cyber challenges that registered users will have to solve the system.

These challenges are virtual machines that are running in a controlled environment within an internal network developed for this purpose. The challenges are specially created to be hacked since they have a series of vulnerabilities that must be exploited. In order for users to connect to these virtual
machines, they must connect through a VPN to this internal network.

Once the user is ready to solve the challenge, they are provided with the IP address to which they have to start performing an analysis in search of different vulnerabilities in order to find faults in that system, once they take advantage of those faults they should find the different solutions that must be introduced on the platform, this will make the user earn points , which will accumulate, thus creating a ranking with all users.
